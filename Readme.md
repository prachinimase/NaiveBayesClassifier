# Naive Bayes Classifier
Data mining [Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).
Find the maximum probability of the given unseen tuple(data).

## Steps for algorithm
1. Calculate the probability of the class(Class Probabilities).
2. Conditional probability of each attributes.
3.  Probability of the data with respect to class attribute.
4. Maximizing the probability with class probabilities. </br>
``` P(class|data) = P(X|class) * P(class) ```
